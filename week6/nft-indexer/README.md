# Simple NFT Indexer

This is an skeleton app that uses the Alchemy SDK rigged to Alchemy's Enhanced APIs in order to display all of an address's ERC-721 tokens, including a call to any `image` attached to their metadata.

## Set Up

1. Install dependencies by running `npm install`
2. Start application by running `npm run dev`

## Challenge

Fork this repo and build out more features! This is minimalistic on purpose.

We purposefully built this out to be a skeleton version of what can be the next big thing so that you can practice some software development! Here are a few challenge suggestions:

1. Add Wallet integration so that any user that connects their wallet can check see their NFTs in a flash!
2. There is no indication of a request in progress... that's bad UX! Do you think you can add some sort of indication of loading?
3. Add some styling! ðŸŽ¨
4. The NFT images can sometimes appear and sometimes not... can you think of ways to fix that?
5. There is no error-checking for wrongly formed requests, or really any error checking of any kind... can you add some in?
6. The images and grid display could look better... anything you can do about that?
7. There are ways to make this app faster... can you implement some of them? How can the query be made _even_ quicker?
8. Can you add ENS support for inputs?
9. The code has no commenting... bruh! Clear documentation is a clear path for other developers to understand and build on your code... think you can add clear commenting?
10. Completely open-ended!! Use this as the base for your next hackathon project, dream company or personal expedition :)
